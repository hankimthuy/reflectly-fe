# MimoSe - Product Requirements Summary

## Overview

**MimoSe** is a "Leading Self" ecosystem designed to help users navigate between introspection and action. The application provides a dual-mode experience that supports both personal reflection and outward engagement with the world.

---

## Core Philosophy

MimoSe operates on the principle that effective self-leadership requires balance between:
- **Reflection** — Understanding yourself, your emotions, and your inner state
- **Action** — Engaging with the external world and taking purposeful steps forward

---

## The Two Modes

### 🌙 Innerverse (Dark Mode / Reflection)

The Innerverse is the introspective space where users:
- Journal and reflect on thoughts and emotions
- Track energy levels and emotional patterns
- Practice mindfulness and self-awareness
- Review personal insights and growth

**Visual Identity:** Dark, cool colors (Blues, Purples) — calming and contemplative

### ☀️ Outerverse (Light Mode / Action)

The Outerverse is the action-oriented space where users:
- Plan and execute tasks
- Connect with their social orbit (relationships)
- Set and track goals
- Engage with the external world

**Visual Identity:** Light, warm colors (Oranges, Yellows) — energizing and motivating

---

## The Bridge

The **Bridge** is the transition mechanism between Innerverse and Outerverse. It represents the conscious shift between reflection and action states.

### Transition Mechanics

1. **Triggering the Bridge**
   - User-initiated toggle or gesture
   - Contextual prompts based on user patterns

2. **The Crossing Experience**
   - Animated visual transition using `framer-motion`
   - Smooth color palette morphing (Cool → Warm or Warm → Cool)
   - Optional micro-interaction (haptic feedback, sound)

3. **State Persistence**
   - Current mode saved to user preferences
   - Last mode restored on app launch
